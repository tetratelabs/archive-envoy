# This is an Envoy® plug-in to extract_release_version.sh and called in a loop for each OS and
# architecture for a given version. The result is a distribution directory including the `envoy` binary.
#
#  * The first parameter ($1) is the release version. Ex. v1.18.3 or v1.18.3_debug.
#    * The "_debug" suffix toggles if the binary is stripped and if debug symbols are included.
#  * The second parameter ($2) is the operating system: darwin, linux or windows
#  * The third parameter ($3) is the architecture: amd64 or arm64
#  * The fourth parameter ($4) is the `car` mode: extract or list
#    * list exits successfully if the expected files are available in OCI layers
#  * The fifth parameter ($5) is the directory to extract files into
#
# The result is envoy-$version-$os-$arch which contents appropriate per platform
#  Ex. envoy-v1.18.3-linux-amd64/bin/envoy
#  Ex. envoy-v1.18.3-windows-amd64/bin/envoy.exe
